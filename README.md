# Trend Windows Shopify Migration Case Study

## Project Overview
Trend Windows is an international client website containing a mix of product-based and informational (non-ecommerce) pages.  
The legacy system was difficult to manage and suffered from performance and scalability issues.

The client migrated the website to Shopify to improve stability, performance, and long-term maintainability while keeping the existing design intact.
